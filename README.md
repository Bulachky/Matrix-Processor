# Matrix-Processor
processor.py is a program which has the capabilities of creating matrices from input, then doing addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transposing in all directions  (main diagonal, side diagonal, horizontally and vertically), finding the determined of a square matrix and the inverse of a matrix (also square matrix).

-  First the program asks the user what he would like to do by entering an integer between 0 - 6 (main prompt, other inputs just trigger the prompt again) 
- After the user makes a choice than the program prompts the user for the dimensions of a matrix than the elements of the matrix one row at the time, depending on the choice of the action the user would like to do the user might be asked to input the dimensions and elements of a second matrix.
- The program prints out the result of the operation 
- The main prompt is printed again
- If the user inputs the integer "0" the program stops
